Sorry, there was an error, restart; We are creating a complete disassembly of the NES game `Dragon Warrior 4` the US version with asset extraction/resinsertion in a complete build pipeline; Our home folder is `C:\Users\me\source\repos\dragon-warrior-4-info`;  create a new public github repos named `dragon-warrior-4-info` that is a complete code and asset disassembly of `Dragon Warrior 4` (`DW4`) with full editors for all assets and use those assets in the build pipeline; turn on github issues for the project (and make a github project that is always associated with all github issue tracking work and kanban board), during this planning process, and when planning or making new un-planned work, always create todo-lists and create githuib issues and epics; and update them as you complete work; always create session logs in `~docs\session-logs` and ai chat logs at `~docs\chat-logs\` as markdown (`.md`) log files; For reference: use the `dragon-warrior-info` project for the Dragon Warrior (DW1) disassembly (`https://github.com/TheAnsarya/dragon-warrior-info` / `C:\Users\me\source\repos\dragon-warrior-info`) and Final Fantasy Mystic Quest (FFMQ) disassembly (`https://github.com/TheAnsarya/ffmq-info` / `C:\Users\me\source\repos\ffmq-info`); copy all necessary files, like the editorconfig (*always use tabs, never spaces, for all files forever*) and always format files (tabs! `{` and `}` on the same line as the rest of the code!); The standard reference rom, that we are disassembling and using in comparisons after builds is `C:\Users\me\source\repos\dragon-warrior-4-info\roms\Dragon Warrior IV (1992-10)(Enix)(US).nes` (relative path `.\roms\Dragon Warrior IV (1992-10)(Enix)(US).nes`), This is the source of truth; make sure to copy Ophis over so we have a compiler; our goal is a complete disassembly of the game like the other projects, with a full universal editor that edits all extracted assets and some code like damage calculation or spell effects; Use as a reference for information on the NES game DW4 `C:\Users\me\source\repos\GameInfo\Dragon Warrior 4 (NES)`; ****** Primary: make this whole project and github it and PLAN everything we will need to do for this, including manual and automated testing;


make `dragon-warrior-4-info` into a git repos and push it to github as a public repos, turn on `github issues` for this repository, then create a github project for `Dragon Warrior 4` and then make a SCRUMM board for the issues and make issues and todo-lists and epics for everything we're planning to do to to make this project complete;
